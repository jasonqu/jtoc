Jtoc is a library for writing test assertions in Java, which provides an easy way to write contracts with java's inner class. Compared with <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract#Languages_with_third-party_support'>other libraries</a>, Jtoc focuses on **completely** test the contracts **without** changing the original design of the class. It supports Unit testing, where the written JUnit tests could be used in the test-project Jtoc generated without any change.

Jtoc is created by using two open source library -- <a href='http://code.google.com/p/javaparser/'>javaparser</a> created and maintained by <a href='http://code.google.com/u/jgesser/'>J. V. Gesser</a> as the Java grammar parser, apache-commons-logging as the logger.
